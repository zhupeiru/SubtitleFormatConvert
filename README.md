# SubtitleFormatConvert

People are often troubled by a video player without supporting a particular
subtitle format, especially for many app of mobile devices.

This project is to transform subtitle between many different popular formats, such as
vtt, srt...

The project is implemented using Java in order to make it convenient to be used across different platforms. And it interacts with a simple GUI, which makes it possible for non-professional people. The IDE I use is Eclipse and the flowing is the steps to create a project to develop. Other IDE are very similar:
1)git clone the project;
2)File>New>java Project;
3)Pick a project name "SubtitleFormatConvert";
4)Uncheck use default location, choose the path of the project you had download in 1);

You can download the executed file in http://download.csdn.net/detail/zhupeiru2/8871495
